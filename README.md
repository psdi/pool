# Pool (work in progress)
Pool is a simple, framework-less notes web application.

Other details (installation, usage, etc.) coming soon!

### Dependencies
- Twig template engine
- PSR-11 container interface

### Motivation
I wanted to create a personal app-thing where I could write notes/drafts without having to create individual files. For school we have to write these weekly reports and I wanted to be able to store my preliminary thoughts somewhere. Technically, I could have utilized probably a thousand (free, superior) available services, but I *really* wanted to practice programming. :sweat_smile:
